# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I started making this website with goal of it being a study guide for my bootcamp. I learned alot more through the process of building the site than is actually reflected by the words on the page. I learned so much through the process of builduing this, that I can't communicate all the information in this paragraph. Hopefully after three months I can update this better express my knowledge.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

At this point I don't how much use anyone will get out of this. It still needs some work. But it is my goal to create something that will be usefull, hopefully to many.
